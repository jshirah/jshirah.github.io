<p><strong>I am a senior Chemistry and Mathematics double major at URI. I am a member of several organizations on campus including 
    The Puppy Raiser's Club, Alpha Chi Sigma (the professional chemistry fraternity), the marching band, and was a member of the dressage team.
    </strong>
</p>    
    <p><strong> The Puppy Raisers Club partners with <a href="https://www.guidingeyes.org/" id="guidingeyes"> Guiding Eyes for the Blind</a>, a non-profit based out of New York. 
        Several members raise dogs from the age of 10 weeks to 1.5 years old. I am a certified puppy sitter and volunteer to watch the dogs while their raisers have classes. 
        Pictured in the left photo is Umberto one of the puppies this year, he is an 8 month old black lab.
